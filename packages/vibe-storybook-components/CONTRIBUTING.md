### Storybook
As the main development environment and documentation playground, we are using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
Each component should be developed in isolation in the Storybook environment.
You can read more about our docs implementation best practices [here](COMPONENTS_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDELINES.md).

### Linting
We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with the default community guidelines. Please, make sure that you are formatting your code with prettier.

### Commits
We are using [Semantic commits](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) convention for creating Pull Requests and commits messages inside the Pull Request.
